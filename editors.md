# Editor help
This is a list of editors and what string to use in `script.config` for them. 

#### NOTE: IF USING ATOM, GO INTO IT, SELECT "ATOM" AND SELECT "INSTALL SCRIPT COMMANDS" BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT!

Any editor, so long as it has a terminal command to open it, will work with this.

```
Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode): code
Atom: atom
```

Please add to this list!
